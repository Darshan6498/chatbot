Conversational Chatbot Application

A full-stack chatbot application built with React.js (frontend) and MongoDB (backend storage) as part of the STAN Internship Challenge.
The chatbot goes beyond simple Q&A by demonstrating human-like conversations, contextual awareness, memory persistence, and personalization.
